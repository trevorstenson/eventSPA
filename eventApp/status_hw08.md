https://github.com/trevorstenson/eventApp


4. What's the URL that you deployed to?
events.downwind.xyz

The photo functionality is missing.
Other than that functionality includes:

- inviting users
- respond to invite with a yes or no
- overview of invitees
- editing events
- deleting comments (as both owner and specific users)

### Design Decisions

- You need to be logged in to view any events
- You can only see events you own or been invited to
- You respond yes or no to an event on the event page itself


1. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yes!
