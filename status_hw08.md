Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
Trevor Stenson


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/trevorstenson/eventSPA


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
http://events-spa.downwind.xyz


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
Most functionality is complete. Due to windows architecture I had issues
supporting Argon2 for salting passwords, so I have removed enforcement of
this for now but will attempt implementation on deploy in the VPS.

I also ran into issues with the serialization of JSON specifically for the Invite struct.

Upon running into this error I was unable to figure out the issue and as a result replying to
invites is not working.


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Should be.
